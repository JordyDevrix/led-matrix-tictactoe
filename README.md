# tic tac toe on luma matric
This repo is the result of a few weeks of research and starting with the raspberry pi from scratch to build a nintendo like device to play tic tac toe against a randomised algorithm.

The repository contains several files which I used to test multiple things which I would've used to make the tic tac toe game work on the RaspberryPi with the led matrix, like threading and a working 3 level console version of tic tac toe.
For the led matrix I used the max7219 with the luma.core ledmatrix library. All info and the (in my opinion) most effective and simplest install guide can be found [here](https://raspberrytips.nl/max7219-led-8x8/)
